👋 Hi, I’m Łukasz Łaszek (Gambeat007)!

Today I am working on being better person than I was yesterday. My motto is: "Don't try to be better than others, be better than yourself".

I believe that hard work full of mistakes is a best way to learn coding, because in my opnion learn to code is not hard - it is very demanding.

I like to plan, optimse and increase efectiveness of processes in a business and personal life. I am practising self-awareness and observation skills.

Current technologies: Java, Spring, Typescript, React with helpers: Maven, Swagger, Postman.

If you want to contact me, send an email to: laszek.lukasz(at)gmail.com

Cheers!

Ł.Ł.
