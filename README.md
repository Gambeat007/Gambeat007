👋 Hi, I’m Łukasz Łaszek (Gambeat007)!

Today I am working on being better person than I was yesterday. 
My motto is: "Don't try to be better than others, be better than yourself".

I believe that hard work full of mistakes is a best way to learn coding, 
because in my opnion learn to code is not hard - it is very demanding.
I wish I can be great "lazy" (lazy in a good meaning) developer. 
Clean Code, KISS, DRY, YAGNI are my best friends. 

I like to plan, optimse and increase efectiveness of processes in a business and personal life. 
I am practising self-awareness and observation skills.

Current technologies - backend: Java, Spring, frontend - Typescript, React.
Helpers: Maven, Swagger, Postman.

If you want to contact me, send email to: laszek.lukasz(at)gmail.com,
cheers!
